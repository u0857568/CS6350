# This is a machine learning library developed by Yu Song for CS6350 in University of Utah.
#
# To use decision tree, 
# use command like "python id3.py -train car/train.csv -test car/test.csv -car -depth 1"
# "-train" for trainning and "-test" for testing; "-car" for car and "-bank" for bank.
# adding "-ME" for me, "-GI" for gi, "-missing" for missing values
#
# To use adaboost,
# "python adaboost.py"
# To use bagged trees,
# "python baggedtrees.py"
# To use randomforests,
# "python randomforests.py"
# To use linear regression,
# "python gradients.py"
# To use percaptron,
# "python perceptron.py"
# To use SVM,
# "python run_SVM.py"
#
# hw5:
# To use Neural Network,
# "python nn.py"
# To use PyTorch RRLU,
# "python PyTorch.py"
# To use PyTorch tanh,
# "python pytorch_tanh.py"
# To use logistic regression,
# "python lr.py"
# 
# To run the final project
# recommand to run "Final.ipynb" in jupyter notebook
# or "python Final.ipynb"(strongly recommand jupyter notebook!)
